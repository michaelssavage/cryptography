The Miller-Rabin primality test was created by Gary Miller and Michael O. Rabin and also makes use of Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem. 

To test an odd number **n** for primality, we let **2^k** be the largest power of **2** dividing **n-1**. Thus we have  **n-1 = 2^k(m)** for some odd number **m**.

Modular exponentiation is widely used in public key cryptography. The modular exponentiation **a^x(mod n)** is just repeated multiplication (**a** multiplied by itself **x** times).

The Euclidean Algorithm is a technique for quickly finding the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers.
